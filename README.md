an explanation on how regex works in my words

  -First of all when opening up the visual code file, the first thing you want to do it hit control F.
This is a good way to make sure your regX patterns work before you try to inplement them into python script.
  
  
  -Second if with control F panel open if you type (\d) you will be searching for all valid digits, so any number between 1-9 will be highlighted.
\D will highlight any non digits withing the code.
 
 
 -Using regX to implement a valid email code is very useful to use within a website to make sure when people sign up that the email is a valid/existing one.
